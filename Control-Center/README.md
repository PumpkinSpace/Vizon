Future changes.

Integrate mission selection into graphing page.

Integrate the two databases.  I see no issues with them being in one.  Works right
now though.

Need to change the way models in taplog are made.  I'm no longer using field values,
so the whole concept of having a f: { n: "", v: * } in there is obsolete.  Doesn't harm
anyone right now though.

If a TAP model is changed in the admin UI it doesn't update the TAP model saved in cache.
This needs a fix.

I think GS side has support for new tap scehma names.  Nee to fix for CAPS.  
Support for graphing needs mission select button.
